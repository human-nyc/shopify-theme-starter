Dawn 15.2.0 provides a few fixes for known bugs and updates the styling for the new dynamic checkout buttons.
### Changed
- Adjust the local selector dropdown to match the maximum width of its content.
- Adjust the styling for dynamic checkout buttons now that they’re using a new HTML structure.
### Fixes and improvements
- Fix issue where while in the theme editor, a modal wouldn’t be cleared once the section it belonged to was removed.
- Updated the account login link to use a nofollow attribute so that google doesn’t interpret it as spammy backlinking.
- Fix issue where the svg icon for the filters were not clickable
